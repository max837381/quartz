Mathematically, if we denote consumption as C and disposable income as Y, the derivative of consumption with respect to disposable income is written as dC/dY. This derivative can be positive, negative, or zero.</p><ul><li><p>Positive derivative (dC/dY > 0): This indicates that consumption increases as disposable income increases.

It implies that as individuals or households have more disposable income, they tend to save more or allocate the additional income towards other purposes rather than increasing consumption.</p></li><li><p>Zero derivative (dC/dY = 0): This indicates that there is no relationship or dependency between changes in disposable income and consumption. In other words, changes in disposable income do not affect consumption behavior.</p></li></ul><p>The derivative of consumption with respect to disposable income, denoted as dC/dY, can be interpreted as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

In this analysis, we assume a CRRA utility function</p><p>where $\rho$ is the discount rate and $\theta$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion</p><p>CRRA utility function</p><p>Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility is a type of utility function that describes an individual&rsquo;s preference for consumption of goods and services. It is based on the assumption that individuals are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a certain outcome to an uncertain one, and that this aversion to risk is constant over time. The CRRA utility function takes the form:</p><p>$$\Large U(C) = (C^(1-γ)-1)/(1-γ)$$</p><p>where U is the utility function, C is consumption, and γ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The higher the value of γ, the greater the individual&rsquo;s aversion to risk.</p><p><strong>Explain how relative risk aversion affects consumption and when it get bigger how does consumption change</strong></p><p>Relative risk aversion refers to an individual&rsquo;s preference for less risky options over riskier ones, even if the potential gains of the latter are greater. In terms of consumption, relative risk aversion can affect an individual&rsquo;s spending habits.</p><p>When an individual has a low level of relative risk aversion, they are more willing to take risks and invest in higher-risk assets or opportunities. This may lead to increased consumption as they are more likely to spend money on things like luxury goods or experiences.</p><p>On the other hand, when an individual has a high level of relative risk aversion, they are more hesitant to take risks and may opt for safer investment options or savings. This may lead to decreased consumption as they are less likely to spend money on non-essential items.</p><p>As relative risk aversion increases, consumption tends to decrease as individuals become more cautious with their spending. This is because they prioritize saving and minimizing financial risks over immediate gratification through consumption.</p><p><strong>Explain how the discount rate affects consumption and when it get bigger how does consumption change with a CRRA utility function</strong></p><p>The discount rate is the rate at which individuals or firms value present consumption over future consumption. A higher discount rate means that individuals or firms place a higher value on present consumption relative to future consumption. This can have a significant impact on consumption decisions.</p><p>When the discount rate increases, individuals or firms are more likely to prioritize present consumption over future consumption. This means that they may be more likely to spend their money now rather than saving it for later. As a result, an increase in the discount rate can lead to an increase in current consumption.</p><p>However, when considering a CRRA (Constant Relative Risk Aversion) utility function, the impact of an increase in the discount rate on consumption becomes more complex. The CRRA utility function assumes that individuals are risk-averse and prefer a smooth and stable level of consumption over time.</p><p>In this case, an increase in the discount rate may actually lead to a decrease in current consumption if it leads to greater uncertainty about future income or if it makes individuals more risk-averse. This is because higher discount rates make future income less valuable, which can lead individuals to save more in order to smooth out their level of consumption over time.</p><p>Overall, the impact of changes in the discount rate on consumption depends on a variety of factors, including individual preferences and attitudes towards risk.</p><a href=#maximization-problem><h2 id=maximization-problem><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Maximization Problem</h2></a><a href=#lagrangian><h4 id=lagrangian><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lagrangian</h4></a><a href=#focs><h4 id=focs><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>FOCs:</h4></a><p>This analysis implies that once we allow for the possibility of that real interest rate and the discount rate are not equal, consumption need not to be a random walk.</p><p>r = real interest rate

It is expected to be positive since people have basic needs that must be satisfied even if they have no income.</p><p>The slope coefficient (b) represents the marginal propensity to consume, which is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption. It is expected to be positive but less than one since people tend to save a portion of their income as a precautionary measure or to invest it.</p><p>Therefore, the correct option is (a) 𝑎 > 0, 𝑏 &lt; 1.</p><p>What is the permanent income hypothesis in economics</p><p>The permanent income hypothesis is an economic theory that suggests that an individual&rsquo;s consumption patterns are determined by their long-term or permanent income, rather than their current income or temporary fluctuations in income. According to this theory, individuals base their consumption decisions on the average level of their expected future income, rather than just their current earnings.</p><p>This theory was first proposed by economist Milton Friedman in 1957 and has since been widely studied and debated in the field of economics. The permanent income hypothesis suggests that individuals save more when they have a higher permanent income, as they can afford to set aside more money for the future without reducing their current standard of living.</p><p>Overall, the permanent income hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how individuals make consumption decisions over time and how these decisions are influenced by factors such as earnings, savings, and expectations about future income levels.</p><p>Why is the derivative of disposable income equal to MPC</p><p>The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is defined as the proportion of additional disposable income that is spent on consumption. The derivative of disposable income with respect to consumption represents the rate at which consumption changes in response to changes in disposable income. Therefore, the derivative of the consumption function with respect to disposable income is equal to MPC because it measures the change in consumption resulting from a change in disposable income. In other words, as disposable income increases by a certain amount, the derivative of consumption represents how much additional spending will occur due to that increase, and this is precisely equal to the MPC.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/quartz/Gross-Domestic-Product/ data-ctx=Consumption data-src=/Gross-Domestic-Product class=internal-link>Gross Domestic Product</a></li><li><a href=/quartz/Macroeconomics/ data-ctx=Consumption data-src=/Macroeconomics class=internal-link>Macroeconomics</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Max Landesz using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlandesz>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/max837381>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://maxlandesz.com>Website</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
