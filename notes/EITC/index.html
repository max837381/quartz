It is a refundable tax credit for low to moderate-income working individuals and families. The EITC is designed to provide financial assistance to those who are struggling to make ends meet, while also incentivizing work.</p><p>An example of the EITC in terms of economics would be a family with two children and an income of $25,000 per year. Without the EITC, this family might struggle to pay for basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. However, with the EITC, they may qualify for a credit of up to $5,600, which could significantly improve their financial situation and help them meet their basic needs.</p><p>Overall, the EITC is an important tool in reducing poverty and promoting economic mobility by providing targeted financial assistance to those who need it most.</p><a href=#model><h2 id=model><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Model</h2></a><a href=#basic-setup><h4 id=basic-setup><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Basic Setup</h4></a><ul><li>Utility: C</li></ul><hr><p>Sure, let&rsquo;s break down this model step by step. This is a labor supply model with an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) type program. The aim of the model is to find out how different individuals (&ldquo;types&rdquo;) choose to supply labor (i.e., how many hours they work) given their personal preferences for leisure and the structure of the EITC program.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with some definitions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Utility function</strong>: The utility function is given by C + αln(HL), where:</p><ul><li>C is a composite consumption good, which is typically bought with income from working.</li><li>H represents available hours, which could be used for work or leisure.</li><li>L is hours worked.</li><li>α is a parameter that represents the individual&rsquo;s preference for leisure. The larger α is, the more the individual values leisure relative to consumption.</li><li>The term ln(HL) represents the logarithm of leisure hours. Since H is the total hours available and L is hours worked, H - L would be hours of leisure. Therefore, this term increases as leisure increases.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>EITC Program</strong>: This is a simplified model of a real-world policy where the government provides a subsidy to low-income workers. In this model, the EITC program works as follows:</p><ul><li>For income up to $1000, there is a 40% subsidy. This means that for every dollar earned, the worker gets an additional 40 cents from the government. This is known as the phase-in region.</li><li>For income between $1000 and $1200, the benefit is fixed at $400.</li><li>For income above $1200, the benefit starts to decrease at a rate of 20% for each dollar earned, until it becomes zero at income=$3200. This is known as the phase-out region.</li></ul></li></ol><p>The model is solved by finding the optimal labor supply in different segments of the EITC program:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Non-participation</strong>: Some individuals might choose not to work at all. According to the model, this happens if the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is greater than or equal to 1.4w, where w is the wage rate. The MRS represents the amount of consumption the individual is willing to give up for an additional hour of leisure. If the MRS is high, it means the individual highly values leisure and might choose not to work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Phase-in region</strong>: Other individuals might choose to work up to the point where their income is $1000 (the end of the phase-in region). These are individuals who value leisure less than the non-participants, but still relatively high. The MRS at the end of the phase-in region is equal to 1.4w, and individuals with an α that corresponds to this MRS will choose to work up to this point.</p></li></ol><p>Finally, the labor supply in each region is found by equating the MRS to the effective wage (which is the wage plus the EITC benefit). The effective wage in the phase-in region is 1.4w, and so the labor supply is found by rearranging the MRS equation to find L.</p><p>The key takeaway from this model is that people&rsquo;s labor supply decisions depend on their personal preferences for leisure (captured by α) and the structure of the EITC program.</p><p>The model is further analyzing the labor supply decisions of individuals based on their preferences for leisure (α), specifically in the first kink point and the flat segment of the EITC program.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break down these two segments:</p><ol><li><p><strong>First kink point (C)</strong>: This is the point where the phase-in region ends and the flat benefit region begins, i.e., where the income is $1000. At this point, the slope of the indifference curve (which represents the tradeoff the individual is willing to make between consumption and leisure) is between w (the wage rate) and 1.4w (the effective wage rate in the phase-in region).</p><p>The upper bound α that makes the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) equal to 1.4w at this kink was found in the previous segment (B). To find the lower bound α that makes the MRS equal to w, the model sets the MRS equal to w when the labor supply L is 1000/w (which is the amount of labor supplied at the first kink). Solving this equation for α gives α = wH - 1000. So, individuals with an α in the range [wH - 1000, 1.4wH - 1400] will choose to work until their income is $1000.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flat segment (D)</strong>: This is the region where the EITC benefit is fixed at $400, i.e., where the income is between $1000 and $1200. The upper bound α for this segment was found in the previous segment (C) as α = wH - 1000.</p><p>To find the lower bound α, the model sets the MRS equal to w when the labor supply L is 1200/w (which is the amount of labor supplied at the second kink). Doing so, you find that individuals with an α in the range [wH - 1200, wH - 1000] will choose to work in this region. The labor supply for these individuals is given by L = H - α/w, which is found by equating the MRS to the wage rate w.</p></li></ol><p>These sections of the model continue to illustrate how individuals&rsquo; labor supply decisions are influenced by their personal preferences for leisure and the structure of the EITC program. In particular, it shows that the kinks in the EITC schedule, where the effective wage rate changes, can lead to jumps in the labor supply.</p><p>The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) is the rate at which an individual is willing to give up one good (in this case, leisure time) in exchange for another good (in this case, consumption), while maintaining the same level of utility or satisfaction.</p><p>In this model, if the MRS is greater than or equal to 1.4w, it means that an individual values their leisure time so highly that they would need to be compensated at a rate of at least 1.4w for every hour of leisure they give up to work.</p><p>Remember that 1.4w is the effective wage during the phase-in region of the EITC program, where the government is supplementing 40% of the individual&rsquo;s wage.</p><p>So, if an individual&rsquo;s MRS is greater than or equal to 1.4w, it means that they value their leisure time at least as much as the enhanced wage they would receive if they chose to work. In other words, the additional consumption they could get from working and earning income (even with the EITC supplement) isn&rsquo;t enough to compensate for the loss of leisure time. As a result, these individuals choose not to participate in the labor market at all—they supply zero hours of labor (L=0).</p><p>This demonstrates one of the fundamental trade-offs in economics: individuals must decide how to allocate their scarce resources (in this case, time) between different options (in this case, work and leisure) based on their personal preferences and the available opportunities.</p><p>This part of the model discusses two segments:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Second kink (E)</strong>: This is the point where the flat segment of the EITC program ends, and the phase-out region begins, i.e., where the income is $1200. The model notes that there is no individual type that will choose a labor supply in the phase-out region. The reason is that the marginal benefit of working additional hours (which is the wage minus the reduction in the EITC benefit) is lower than the marginal cost (which is the loss of leisure time). This makes it not worthwhile for individuals to work additional hours in the phase-out region.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ineligible (G)</strong>: This is the segment where individuals earn too much to qualify for the EITC program. The model wants to find the individual type that is indifferent between working in segment G and at the second kink point E. To do this, it equates the utility of working in segment E and G.</p><p>The utility at segment E (UE) is straightforward to calculate because the consumption and labor supply are known (C = $1600 and L = 1200/w). The utility at segment G (UG) is calculated by plugging the expressions for consumption and labor supply into the utility function. However, equating UE and UG does not yield a closed-form solution for α.</p><p>Therefore, the model suggests using a numerical method (a grid search) to find the value of α that makes an individual indifferent between working in segment G and at the second kink point E. In the given example (where H = 2000 and w = 10), the cutoff α is 15058, and the corresponding labor supply in segment G is 494 hours.</p></li></ol><p>The model concludes by noting that the EITC program can cause individuals to reduce their labor supply significantly to maximize their EITC benefit and enjoy more leisure time. In the given example, a worker who would have worked 493 hours without the EITC program would choose to work only 120 hours to maximize the EITC benefit. This demonstrates one of the potential unintended effects of such programs: they might discourage work among some individuals.</p><p>I apologize for any confusion; that statement was a bit unclear. Let&rsquo;s correct it:</p><p>In the given example, when H = 2000 and w = 10, the cutoff α for segments E (the second kink point) and G (ineligible for EITC) is found to be 15058. This means that a worker with this value of α is indifferent between working at the second kink point (where they would work 1200/w = 120 hours to earn $1200 and maximize their EITC benefit) and working in segment G.</p><p>If this worker was in segment G (ineligible for EITC), their labor supply would be L = H - α/w = 2000 - 15058/10 = 494 hours. So, this worker, who without the EITC program would choose to work 494 hours, will now choose to work only 120 hours to maximize the EITC benefit and enjoy more leisure time.</p><p>The main point is that the EITC program can create disincentives for work at certain income levels. Although it provides additional income for low-income workers, the phase-out of the EITC benefit can lead some individuals to reduce their labor supply to stay within the range that qualifies for the maximum benefit.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Max Landesz using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlandesz>LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/max837381>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://maxlandesz.com>Website</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
