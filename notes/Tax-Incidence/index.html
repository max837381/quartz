Does this relate to Marginal revenue equals marginal cost and can be say p = marginal revenue here?</p><p><em>The marginal condition p = c&rsquo;(S(p)) is equivalent to marginal revenue equals marginal cost in perfect competition. In this case, the price (p) that a firm receives for its product is equal to the additional cost (c&rsquo;) of producing an extra unit of output at the level of supply (S(p)). Therefore, we can interpret p as the marginal revenue earned by the firm.</em> #todo</p><p><em>The relationship between the marginal condition p = c&rsquo;(S(p)) and the principle &ldquo;marginal revenue equals marginal cost&rdquo; is that both are used to determine the optimal level of production for a firm.</em></p><p>The marginal condition p = c&rsquo;(S(p)) represents the point at which the price of a good equals the cost of producing an additional unit of that good. It is essentially a supply-side perspective on determining optimal production levels.</p><p>On the other hand, &ldquo;marginal revenue equals marginal cost&rdquo; represents the point at which the additional revenue generated by producing one more unit of a good is equal to the additional cost incurred in producing that unit. This principle is often used from a demand-side perspective, as it helps determine how much consumers are willing to pay for each additional unit of a good.</p><p>However, both approaches ultimately aim to find the level of production that maximizes profit for a firm. By setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost or finding where price equals cost, firms can optimize their production levels and avoid inefficiencies such as overproduction or underproduction.</p><p>In addition, tax incidence can also be analyzed using these principles. When a tax is imposed on a good, it affects both supply and demand curves and ultimately changes the equilibrium price and quantity. By analyzing how taxes affect supply and demand curves, economists can determine who bears most of the burden of taxation - either producers or consumers - and how much each side bears relative to each other.</p><p>The equation p = c&rsquo;(S(p)) represents the condition where the price (p) equals the marginal cost of production (c&rsquo;) at a given level of supply (S(p)). This is similar to the condition in MR=MC, where the marginal revenue earned from selling an additional unit of a good is equal to its marginal cost of production.</p><p>Both conditions are important in determining the equilibrium price and quantity of a good in a market. In a perfectly competitive market, where there are many buyers and sellers and no barriers to entry or exit, the supply function is perfectly elastic and the market price is determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. At this equilibrium point, MR=MC holds true for all firms in the market, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.</p><p>However, when taxes are imposed on a good, they affect both consumers and producers by altering their behavior. The incidence of tax can be analyzed using either the demand or supply curve. If we analyze it using the supply curve, we can see that taxes shift it upward by an amount equal to the tax per unit of output. This results in an increase in price paid by consumers and a decrease in net revenue received by producers. The extent to which each group bears this burden depends on their relative price elasticities of demand and supply.</p><p>In summary, understanding tax incidence requires an understanding of both supply and demand functions as well as their relationship with MR=MC.</p><p>The marginal condition p = c&rsquo;(S(p)) means that the price (p) of good x is equal to the marginal cost (c&rsquo;) of producing it at the level of supply (S(p)). In other words, producers will only supply good x at a price that covers their marginal costs.</p><p>This concept is important in understanding tax incidence, which refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed between buyers and sellers in a market. When a tax is imposed on good x, it increases the cost of production for sellers and therefore shifts the supply curve upwards. As a result, the equilibrium price for good x increases, but the quantity demanded decreases.</p><p>The incidence of the tax depends on the relative elasticities of demand and supply. If demand is relatively inelastic (i.e., buyers are not very responsive to changes in price), then most of the burden of the tax will fall on buyers as they continue to purchase relatively large quantities at higher prices. If supply is relatively inelastic (i.e., sellers are not very responsive to changes in price), then most of the burden will fall on sellers as they continue to produce relatively large quantities despite facing higher costs.</p><p>In summary, understanding the relationship between price, marginal cost, and supply is key to understanding how taxes affect market outcomes and who bears their burden.</p><p><strong>Perfect optimization</strong> in this context refers to the condition where suppliers of good x are able to produce and sell the good at the <strong>lowest possible cost, while also maximizing their profits.</strong> This involves making efficient use of resources and minimizing waste, while also ensuring that the price of the good is set at a level that is both competitive and profitable. By achieving perfect optimization, suppliers are able to operate at maximum efficiency and generate the highest possible returns on their investment. The supply function for good x is implicitly defined by this marginal condition because it represents the point at which suppliers are able to balance their costs with the price they charge for the product, resulting in a state of equilibrium where supply meets demand.</p><p>Let denote $\Large \epsilon_S$ denote the price elasticity of supply</p><a href=#equilibrium><h4 id=equilibrium><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Equilibrium</h4></a><p>Government levies an excise tax on good x</p><p>This is a tax that is levied on a quantity (e.g. gallon, pack, ton)</p><p><strong>The elasticities of demand and supply</strong> determine <strong>tax incidence</strong> in this case</p><p>An excise tax is a tax on specific goods or services, such as cigarettes or gasoline. The tax is usually added to the price of the product and paid by the consumer at the point of sale.</p><p>However, the incidence, or burden, of the tax may be shared between producers and consumers depending on the elasticity of supply and demand.</p><p>Generally, if demand is more elastic than supply, producers will bear a larger portion of the tax burden, while if supply is more elastic than demand, consumers will bear a larger portion.</p><p>Ad-valorem tax: fraction of prices (e.g. sales tax)</p><p>Now with the tax:</p><p>q = p + t</p><ul><li>q = post-tax price (tax inclusive price)</li><li>p = pre-tax price</li><li>t = tax</li></ul><p>Equilibrium:</p><p>$$\large Q = S(p) = D(p+t)$$
The equilibrium with an excise tax of t is given by the intersection of the supply curve S(p) and the demand curve D(p+t). This is because the excise tax increases the cost of production for suppliers, shifting the supply curve upwards by the amount of the tax.</p><p>The tax burden falls on both suppliers and consumers, but it is determined by their respective price elasticities of demand and supply. If demand is relatively inelastic (less responsive to price changes), then consumers will bear most of the tax burden. Conversely, if supply is relatively inelastic (less responsive to price changes), then suppliers will bear most of the tax burden.</p><p>To determine who bears the tax burden, we can use the concept of price elasticity. The price elasticity of demand measures how much consumers&rsquo; quantity demanded changes in response to a change in price, while the price elasticity of supply measures how much suppliers&rsquo; quantity supplied changes in response to a change in price.</p><p>If demand is more elastic than supply (i.e., consumers are more sensitive to price changes than suppliers), then consumers will bear a larger share of the tax burden. Conversely, if supply is more elastic than demand (i.e., suppliers are more sensitive to price changes than consumers), then suppliers will bear a larger share of the tax burden. The actual incidence of the tax depends on how elastic each side&rsquo;s response is and varies from case to case.</p><p>In microeconomics, the equilibrium with an excise tax S(p) = D(p+t) is considered because an excise tax on a good or service shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of the tax. This means that producers will need to charge a higher price to cover their costs and maintain their profit margins. As a result, the equilibrium quantity demanded will decrease, as consumers will be less willing to pay for the higher price.</p><p>On the other hand, the demand curve remains unchanged since consumers&rsquo; willingness to buy is not affected by taxes. However, they will end up paying a higher price for the product due to the increased supply cost. Thus, in this scenario, both producers and consumers share the burden of paying for the excise tax.</p><p>The new equilibrium with S(p) = D(p+t) is found where supply intersects with demand curve after shifting upward by t units. Therefore, this equilibrium reflects an adjustment between buyers and sellers in response to an increase in taxes and is considered optimal as it represents a balance between supply and demand at a new market price level.</p><a href=#side-of-the-market-taxed><h4 id=side-of-the-market-taxed><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Side of the market taxed</h4></a><p><img src=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz//Image%20Bank/Pasted%20image%2020230508181524.png width=auto alt="Pasted image 20230508181524.png"></p><p>pay less to the firm #todo</p><p>Inclusive with the tax you pay more #todo</p><p>Very price unresponsive</p><p><img src=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz//Image%20Bank/IMG_6200%20copy.jpg width=auto alt="IMG_6200 copy.jpg"></p><p><img src=https://maxlandesz.com/quartz//Image%20Bank/IMG_6202%20copy.jpg width=auto alt="IMG_6202 copy.jpg"></p><a href=#principles><h2 id=principles><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Principles</h2></a><ol><li>Incidence is shared between consumers and producers</li><li>Incidence is neutral with respect to the side of the market taxed</li><li>Impact on CS and PS summarized by pass-through rate</li><li>Pass-through rate determined by the relative elasticity of supply and demand</li></ol><p>Explain the points above in terms of microeconomics</p><ol><li><p>Tax incidence refers to the distribution of the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers in a market. In microeconomics, tax incidence is determined by the relative price elasticities of supply and demand. If demand is more elastic than supply, buyers will bear a larger share of the tax burden, whereas if supply is more elastic than demand, sellers will bear a larger share.</p></li><li><p>The neutrality of tax incidence with respect to the side of the market taxed means that regardless of whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers, the overall impact on the market will be the same. This neutrality is based on the assumption that both buyers and sellers are rational and respond to changes in prices in predictable ways.</p></li><li><p>The impact of a tax on consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS) can be summarized by a pass-through rate, which measures how much of the tax burden falls on each side of the market. The pass-through rate reflects the relative price elasticities of supply and demand: if demand is more elastic than supply, buyers will bear a smaller share of the tax burden and PS will decline by more than CS; conversely, if supply is more elastic than demand, sellers will bear a smaller share and CS will decline by more than PS.</p></li><li><p>The pass-through rate is determined by the relative elasticity of supply and demand: if one side has a relatively higher elasticity than the other, it will be able to shift more of the tax burden onto its counterpart. For example, if demand for a good is relatively insensitive to changes in price (i.e., inelastic), while supply is relatively responsive (i.e., elastic), then producers will be able to pass on most or all of any new taxes they face to consumers through higher prices. Conversely, if demand is highly elastic while supply is not, then producers will have little room to raise prices without losing sales volume, so they may end up bearing most of the tax burden themselves.</p></li></ol><a href=#example-of-a-pass-through-rate><h4 id=example-of-a-pass-through-rate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Example of a pass-through rate</h4></a><p>Let&rsquo;s say a government imposes a tax of $2 per unit on a certain good.

By manipulating and controlling certain aspects of the design, researchers can isolate the specific effects of changes in tax rates on different groups of individuals or industries. This can lead to more accurate and precise estimates of tax incidence, which is particularly important when policymakers are considering changes to tax policy that could have significant impacts on various stakeholders. Additionally, an explicit design can help ensure the validity and reliability of the research findings, thereby increasing their credibility and usefulness to policymakers and other stakeholders.</p><p>For example:</p><p>$$\Large q_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$$</p><p>T = treatment (
