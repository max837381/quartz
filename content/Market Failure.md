Correcting market failure

## Externalities

One agent's actions affect others' utility.

Some goods are unpriced - actions do not have rewards or costs that reflect benefit or harm to society.

#### Positive Externality

Vaccinations help others, but lack of reward fails to incentivize getting vaccinated.

#### Negative Externality

Pollution emissions by firms do harm to human health and physical property, yet firms do not incur a cost from polluting.

### How to Intervene?

* Create a price for the action.
  * e.g. (taxes on cigarettes, gasoline, carbon, subsidies for vaccinations, research and development)
* Dictate the desired action to agents.
  * e.g. (fuel economy standard, pollution limits, require students to be vaccinated to attend school)

## Public Goods

Public goods: Common benefit, private cost

Tragedy of the commons

Non-rivalrous

* Free-rider problem
* Achieving efficient outcome requires organization to coordinate the actions of individuals

### How to Intervene?

* Direct provision of the public good
  
  * e.g. building highways, provide national defense and policing, operate national parks
* Subsidize provision of public good

## Asymmetric Information and missing markets

Markets fail when information differs between buyers and sellers

#### Insurance: Health, life, car etc

* Buyer of health insurance has information about how healthy
* Leads to [Adverse Selection](Adverse%20Selection.md). Only the (unobserved to the insurer) sickest buy insraunce
* Government provision, or mandated coverage, may be policy responses
  * avoids [Adverse Selection](Adverse%20Selection.md)

#### Credit constraints and education

* Borrowing against future income may be limited. (Incentive to default)

### Individual failures

Behavorial economics: What about when individual do not seem to act in their own best interests? (e.g. insufficient savings for retirement)

Controversial!

Two views:

* Individual failures do not exist or difficult to identify

* Libertarian view. Individual failures exist and should be addressed. Cognitive limitatoins, self control problems.
  
  * This is the view of behavorial economics
