## Model Complexity

Running a [Regression](Regression.md) with many regressors or powers can increase the complexity of the model

**Least complex model:**

* Null Model: uses no regressors

Having some complexity is useful for prediction and model inference (we do not live in a simple world where x just affects y and that's it)
