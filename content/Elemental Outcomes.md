[Equipossible](Equipossible.md) outcomes and elemental outcomes are not the same.

Elemental outcomes are the possible outcomes of a random experiment or trial, which are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. In other words, every possible outcome of the experiment can be described by a single, unique elemental outcome.

Equipossible outcomes, on the other hand, are outcomes that have an equal probability of occurring. This means that if there are n equipossible outcomes, each of them has a probability of 1/n of occurring.

While it is often assumed that the elemental outcomes of a random experiment are equipossible, this is not always the case. In some situations, the elemental outcomes may have different probabilities of occurring. For example, in a biased coin toss, the elemental outcomes of "heads" and "tails" are not equipossible, as the coin is more likely to land on one side than the other.

In summary, elemental outcomes are the possible outcomes of a random experiment, while equipossible outcomes are outcomes that have an equal probability of occurring. While these concepts are related, they are not the same thing.
