Bayes Box is a tool for visualizing the relationships between *Probability Distribution* and events. It is based on [Bayes Theorem](Bayes%20Theorem.md), which states that the [Probability](Probability.md) of an event, given some prior knowledge, can be calculated by multiplying the [prior probability](Prior%20Probability.md) of the event by the probability of the event given the prior knowledge. This is expressed using the following formula:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, $P(B|A)$ is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred, $P(A)$ is the probability of event A occurring, and $P(B)$ is the probability of event B occurring. Bayes Box takes this formula and visualizes it, giving us a graphical representation of the relationships between probability distributions and events. It can be used to calculate the probability of certain events, given prior knowledge, and can also be used to make predictions about future events.
