National Income

Balance of payment

How are these two topics related?

National income and balance of payment are related because they both provide information on the economic performance of a country. National income accounts measure the total value of goods and services produced in a country over a specific period, while balance of payment accounts measure the transactions between a country and other countries in terms of trade, investment, and financial flows. The balance of payment is influenced by national income as higher national income leads to higher imports, exports, and investments. Therefore, understanding national income provides insight into a country's ability to generate foreign exchange and its impact on the balance of payments. Similarly, analyzing the balance of payments helps to understand how a country's economic activity affects its national income.
