Krugman fundamentals

Don't have a sustainable fixed ER regime

Focus is on the asset side of the economyL Money market and FX market

Assume constant output, the same in both countries: Y = Y\*
make our life easier

Assume constant foreign money supply and interest rate (M\* and i\*)
pretend nothing is happening

M/P = Money Demand -> P = M/Money Demand : similary P\* = M\*/Money Demand\*
Supply of real money balances = money supply/price level should equal money demand in equilibrium
M = money supply

**Money demand is a function of interest rate and output**

We thus will only shift and not move money demand because interest rates are not changing in this example

Assume purchasing power parity = changes in price level in one country = changes in ER * price level changes in another country
Implies ER = ratio of price levels
Higher our price level = more depreciated our currency compared to other countries

Y = fixed
i = endogenous

## Monetary approach to fixed ER

#### At some future time T:

$$\large E_t = P_t/P^\* = (M_T^S/M^{S^*})(\text{Money Demand*/Money Demand)}$$

P = M/Money Demand

#### Under fixed ER ($\large E_0$)

UIP: $\large i_T = i^\*$

This is because of the following (UIP):
$\large i = i^\* + \frac{E^e_T}{E_t}-1$

* Fraction = Future ER expectation/spot rate
* The fraction will equal one under fixed ER thus reduce to 0 and we are left with $\large i = i^\*$

Money market: $\large M\_{T}^S = M^{S^\*}E^0 = M$

* Money supply has to be constant
  No monetary policy autonomy

Money demand has to be fixed too thus through the Et equation we know Money Supply has to be constant too

## Asset Market Equilibrium

Et = spot. rate

Increase the interest rate by lowering money supply
(keep peg)

Increase cost of borrowing
Increase saving, thus reduce consumption

If people expect depreciation, currency depreciates, interest rate going up, inflation adn high interest rates which is not a good combination

## Effect on reserves

HC = Home Currency
FC = Foreign Currency

#### Expected Appreciation

Supply of foreign currency will increase since people want to sell FC to buy HC that is expected to appreciate
Increase demand of foreign currency by accumulating foreign reserves
Left hand side can be done forever

#### Expected Depreciation

Losing reserves, we are supply FC to the market

Sold our foreign reserves to keep the ER fixed

BoP crisis happens, pressure on currency to depreciate but central bank does not have the reserves to keep the peg thus they are forced to float

## Inconsistent monetary and fiscal policies

* Central bank balance sheet
  * Cash (M) = Domestic assets (A) + Foreign assets (OFR = foreign reserves)
* Fixed ER -> M fixed

Suppose Central bank expands domestic credit (increases A)

* To monetize government debt (buy government debt securities, increases domestic assets)
* To stimulate domestic output

Assume domestic assets (A) growing at rate m > 0 -> A_T = A_0(1+m)^T

* future time T
* M is fixed
* Balance sheet of CB: OFR_T + A_T = M
* Official reserves shrink: OFR_T = M - A_0(1+m)^T
* Can find maximum time T1 when reserves are exhausted: OFR_T1 = 0

Foreign assets = OFR in the picture below

## Timing of the BOP crisis

Does the Crisis occur at T_1? **NO**

Crisis occurs before:

* Key insight of Krugman's 1979 seminal work
* **Rational Expectations Equilibrium**
* Start from what happens **After** the crisis we **float** (backwards induction)

Assume reserves are exhausted at time T1

* Post crisis, money supply grows at rate **m** : M_T = A_T + O
  * we dont have any more reserves OFT_t1+ = 0
  * Keep monetizing deficit = print money
* Post crisis, prices and ER grow at rate **m** (float + money neutrality)
* Post crisis, i = i\* + **m**

After T1 , i will be higher than now (pre-crisis)

* At time T_1, i jumps to i\* + m
  * money demand drops
* Takes a form of a run on the currency

Shadow ER = market rate if there were no peg (counterfactual rate during the peg)

* approximated by black market rate

Incentive to beat everyone by selling home currency at T_1

* this can happen until T when there is no more incentive
* Rational expectation equilibrium

## Key characteristics of first generation BOP crisis models

* Crises are **predictable**
  * Inconsistency in monetary and fiscal policy is eventually corrected by the market
  * Suggests looking at few indicators: reserves, money growth, fiscal policy
  * Predicts a dramatic collapse in reserves, but no jump in ER or movement in output
    * But ER often depreciate in large amounts
    * Output also changes (always drops)

Thus we still do not fully understand currency crises (from this model)
