In [Bayesian Statistics](Bayesian%20Statistics.md), the significance of background information, also known as prior knowledge, is crucial in determining the [Probability](Probability.md) of a [Hypothesis](Hypothesis.md) or model given new data.

In Bayesian inference, the *Prior Probability Distribution* represents what we know about the probability of the hypothesis or model before observing any data. 

This prior information can come from previous experiments, domain knowledge, expert opinions, or other sources of information.
