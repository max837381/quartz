Infinity / (infinity + 1) = 1 / 1 = 1

Another way to understand why infinity/infinity+1 = 1 is to consider that infinity is not a specific number, but rather a concept that represents something unbounded or without limit. When we say that infinity/infinity+1 is equal to 1, what we mean is that as the value in the numerator and denominator get larger and larger without bound, the ratio approaches 1. This is because adding 1 to infinity does not significantly affect its value when compared to infinity itself, so the ratio of infinity to infinity+1 is essentially the same as the ratio of infinity to infinity.
