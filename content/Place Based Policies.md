## People vs. places

Transfer programs nromally target people in need. Should we also traget places?

* Target reosurces towards diadvantaged neighbourhoods or regiosn

#### Buffalo Example

Subsidies distort location choices away from productive cities
Income converges between areas anyway
Subsidies to an extent help both poor and rich within area
Blunt instrument

## Estimating rate of convergence

Implication of convergence: Growth rate is faster for areas that are initially lower income

$$\Large y\_{it+1}/y\_{it} = b_0 + b_1 ln(y\_{it}) + BX\_{it} + \epsilon\_{it}$$

Convergence implies catch-up

Low incme means y_it is low thus high convergence

* Convergence implies that the coefficient b_1 is negative

#### Ganong and Shoag (2017)

Externatalities

* Concentrations of industries in high production cost areas suggest there is likely agglomeration economies

## Major downsides to PBP

Amenities will be exogenously given
