A random sample is a subset of a population that is selected in such a way that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. In other words, every member of the population has an equal probability of being selected for the sample.

Random sampling is an important concept in statistics because it allows researchers to make inferences about a larger population based on data collected from a smaller sample. By selecting a random sample, researchers can minimize bias and ensure that their findings are representative of the entire population.

Random sampling is also closely related to other topics in statistics, such as sampling distribution, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. These concepts all rely on the use of random samples to make statistical inferences and draw conclusions about populations. In addition, random sampling is often used in survey research and market research to gather data from a representative sample of individuals or consumers.Define a random sample and how it relates to other topics in statistics
