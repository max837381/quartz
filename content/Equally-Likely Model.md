Also known as ELM
Equal to the [Pascal-Fermat Probability](Pascal-Fermat%20Probability.md) 

Ingredients:

1. An experiment not yet performed with (to you, given [Background Information](Background%20Information.md) $\mathcal{B}$) an [uncertain](Uncertainty.md) outcome.
1. You can list/enumerate all possible outcomes of the experiment $\mathcal{E}$ given $\mathcal{B}$ in such a way that you regard all of them as what [Equipossible](Equipossible.md), thus they are [Elemental Outcomes](Elemental%20Outcomes.md).
