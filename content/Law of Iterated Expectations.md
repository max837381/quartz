The law of iterated expectations is a way of understanding that the [Probability](Probability.md) of something happening is based on the probability of something else happening. It's like a chain reaction!

For example, if you have a bowl of mixed candy, the probability of you picking a blue candy is based on the probability of you picking any candy from the bowl. The probability of picking any candy is based on the probability of you reaching into the bowl.

So the law of iterated expectations is like a chain reaction - one thing happening is based on the probability of something else happening.

English: The law of iterated expectations is a way of understanding that the probability of something happening is based on the probability of something else happening. It's like a chain reaction, where one thing happening is based on the probability of something else happening. For example, the probability of picking a blue candy from a bowl of mixed candy is based on the probability of picking any candy from the bowl, which is based on the probability of reaching into the bowl.

Conditional variance is a measure of how much the variance of a random variable changes when the values of another random variable are taken into account. It is used to show how the expectation of one random variable depends on the values of another random variable. For example, if we have a bowl of candy with different colors, the probability of picking a blue candy changes depending on the probability of picking any candy from the bowl. The conditional variance is a measure of how much the variance changes when the probability of picking any candy from the bowl is taken into account.
