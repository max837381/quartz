Modern datasets have large sample sizes, which require new methods of computation, and are high dimensional, which requires new statistical methods.

* Big 𝑛, which means there is a large number of observations
  
  When 𝑛 is too large, the previously simple act of computing OLS estimates requires distributed algorithms that can process data spread across multiple machines.

* Big 𝑑 (many variables / high-dimensional data)
