The z-value is a measure of how many standard deviations a test statistic (e.g., the estimated coefficient divided by its standard error in logistic regression) is away from its expected value under the null hypothesis. It is calculated by subtracting the null hypothesis value from the observed value and dividing by the standard error. The z-value is used to calculate the p-value, which represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
