Probability distribution is a statistical concept that describes the probabilities of the occurrence of different values in a given set. It can be used to determine the likelihood of certain outcomes when performing statistical analysis. In probability distributions, each possible value of a random variable is associated with a probability.

## Related Topics

Some topics related to probability distributions in statistics are expected values, variance, standard deviation, central limit theorem, binomial distribution, normal distribution, and Poisson distribution. Expected values are used to measure the average outcome of a random process over many trials. 

[Variance](Variance.md) measures how far away from the mean values are spread out on average. Standard deviation provides an indication of how much variation there is in a set of data points from its mean value. 

The [Central Limit Theorem](Central%20Limit%20Theorem.md) states that when independent random variables are added together their sum tends towards a normal distribution. The binomial distribution is used to model situations where there are multiple outcomes with fixed probabilities for each outcome and the total number of trials is finite. 

The [Standard Normal Distribution](Standard%20Normal%20Distribution.md) is one of the most commonly used distributions and models situations where outcomes occur randomly over time or space but cluster around an average value. 

Finally, [Poisson Distribution](Poisson%20Distribution.md) models discrete events that occur at random but with a fixed average rate over time or space.
