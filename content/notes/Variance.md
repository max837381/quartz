This is [Standard Deviation](Standard%20Deviation.md) squared

The variance of a [Random Variable](Random%20Variable.md) is the weighted average of the squared distances between each value x and the expectation of X.

Expectated value of the squared deviation of the mean

$$Var(X) = E\[(X - E\[X])^2]$$
