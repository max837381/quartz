Question: How do food stamps affect grocery store pricing?

What are the sources of variation in food stamp recipiency?

* Food stamps are typically arrive at the same time for a large group of people e.g. first of the month
* Are prices higher when benefits arrive compared to other times of the month within the same store

Why is this a plausible source of variation?

* Non-food expenditures are constant over weeks for benefit households

Referred to as cycling
