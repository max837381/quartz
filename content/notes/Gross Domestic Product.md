### Demand Side

Measured by expenditures, can also be measured by total income, total production or value added

$$\Large GDP = Y =  C + I + G + NX$$

* C = [Consumption](Consumption.md)
* I = [Investment](Investment.md)
* G = [Government Spending](Government%20Spending.md) =  exogenous (taken as given)
* NX = EX - IM = [Net Exports](Net%20Exports.md)

[Current Account](Current%20Account.md) = NX + NFP

NFP = Net factor payments in macroeconomics refer to the difference between the income earned by domestic factors of production (such as labor and capital) from foreign sources, and the income earned by foreign factors of production from domestic sources. In simpler terms, it is the difference between the total payments received by a country from foreign entities for its resources, and the total payments made by a country to foreign entities for their resources. This factor is included in the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to provide a more accurate measure of a country's economic activity.

We could assume = 0 (generally true for US but not other countries)

Balance of Payments

$$\Large Y = GNP = GDP + NFP = NI$$

### Supply Side

Output

$$\Large Y = F(K,L) * TFP$$
If A is in front of the whole equation then = [Total Factor Productivity](Total%20Factor%20Productivity.md)

Unemployment or excess capacity

$$\Large Y = (K^{\gamma} * Z^{1-\gamma})^{\alpha}*(H*L)^{\beta} * T^{1-\alpha-\beta}$$
H = Human capital
Z = intangible capital (measured by R&D for example, another example is branding)
T = land

#### Capital

Capital = spending money over time, accumulate

$$\Large K\_{t+1} = K_t + I_t - \delta K_t$$

delta = depreciation

Log-linearize the equation above: you can a regression

Solow Residual #todo

$$\Large Y = F(K,L): Y = MPK * K + MPL * L$$
Marginal Product of Capital = r

**A good approximation**
Capital share = ⅓
Labor share = ⅔

#### Factors of Production are paid

* Labor input
  
  * paid a wage = w
  * plus fringe benefits
* Capital input
  
  * paid a interest = r
  * real interest or rental rate of capital
* Proprietor income

* Profits

## Real GDP vs Nominal GDP

When measuring GDP, it is common to use both chained volume measures and current prices, but the choice between the two depends on the purpose of the analysis and the type of information you want to convey.

Chained volume measures, also known as real GDP, adjust for changes in prices over time by using a base year to calculate the value of goods and services produced in a given year. Real GDP is useful for comparing economic growth over time, as it allows us to see how much output has increased or decreased after accounting for changes in prices. This makes it a good measure to use if you want to analyze the long-term trend in the economy.

On the other hand, current prices, also known as nominal GDP, do not adjust for changes in prices and represent the value of goods and services produced at current market prices. Nominal GDP is useful for analyzing the current state of the economy and the current level of output, as it reflects the prices and quantities of goods and services being produced in the current period. This makes it a good measure to use if you want to analyze the current level of economic activity or the current market value of output.

In general, if you want to compare economic growth over time or analyze changes in output in real terms, it is appropriate to use chained volume measures. However, if you want to analyze the current state of the economy or the market value of output, it is appropriate to use current prices. It's also worth noting that both measures can provide important insights and can be used together to provide a more complete picture of the economy.

#### Production Approach

No "double counting" in GDP

* Only the final sale of goods and services count

Value Added

* The amount each producer contributes to GDP
* The revenue generated by each producer minus the value of intermediate products

Only new production of goods and services counts towards GDP

e.g. House sold many years ago does not count, only commission fee for Realtor

Gross National Product (GNP):

Market value of all the goods and services produced in one year by labor and property supplied by the citizens of a country

Relation of GDP and GNP

GDP = GNP - NFP
CA = NX + NFP
GNP = C + I + G + CA
GDP = C + I + G + NX
GNP = GDP + NFP = C + I + G + NX + NFP
