Fisher Scoring (MLE) is Newton-Raphson in disguise

* In the basic diagram that illustrates the frequentist inferential paradigm — with the pop- ulation, sample and repeated-sampling data sets, each containing N, n, and M elements, respectively (see, e.g., page 6 of the LDS document camera notes from 31 Jan 2023), and with the sample drawn from the population in an IID manner — when the population parameter of main interest is the mean θ and the estimator is the sample mean Y ̄, as long as the population SD σ satisfies (0 \< σ \< ∞) You will always get a Gaussian long-run distribution for Y ̄ (in the repeated-sampling data set) as long as any one of (N,n,M) goes to infinity.
  * Answer: only if n goes to infinity, the other two are irrelevant to CLT.

Statistical Inference: Induction

Probability: deduction
