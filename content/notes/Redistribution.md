Market outcome may be inequitable

Gains from an efficient market could accrue to a disproportionate share of high-income individuals
Tax and transfer to redistribute

In practice, taxes distort behavior, lead to efficiency loss

Okun's leaky bucket: lose some surplus when transferring form one person to another

## Social Welfare function

Function $\Large W(U_a, U_b)$, so that W is more desireable from society's point of view

**Utilitarian welfare function:**

$\Large W(U_A, U_B) = \theta_A U_A + \theta_B U_B$

* $\theta$'s are weights, can differ across individuals, be proportional to income, etc.

**Egalitarian:**

$\Large W(U_A, U_B) = U_A + U_B - \lambda \sum_i  \[U_i - min{U_A,U_B}]$

* Care about inequality specifically in addition to total utility

**Rawlsian:**

$\Large W(U_A, U_B) = min{U_A,U_B}$

#### Criticisms of utilitarian SWF

Whose utility included? Future generations

Paternalism?

Social preferences, peer effects, and keeping up with the Joneses

Inequality directly affects individual happiness

Base public policy only on individual preferences? What about ethics? Who decides ethics?
