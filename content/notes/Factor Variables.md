I believe this is a way of saying categorical in R #todo

Text data cannot be discrete. That wording is reserved for numerical data.

Also known as a categorical variable

2 categories are sometimes called a [Binomial Variable](Binomial%20Variable.md) (which I believe means it is drawn from the [Binomial Distribution](Binomial%20Distribution.md) #todo)

All you can do is **count** them

With the counts we can get proportions or probabilities
