A null hypothesis is a statement that states that there is no difference between two groups or sets of data. It is used in scientific experiments and research to determine whether a certain outcome is due to chance or if there is a real difference between the groups.

Think of it like this: if you have two groups of people, one group with a certain type of trait and another group without that trait, and you want to test whether there is a difference between the two groups, you can use a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the two groups, and if the results of the experiment show that there is a difference, then it means that the null hypothesis is incorrect and the difference is real.
