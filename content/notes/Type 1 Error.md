False positive

Fail to reject the null hypothesis when it should be rejected?

Accept alternative hyptohesis when it should not be accepted

Explain simply type 1 error

Type 1 error is a statistical term that refers to a situation where a hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. In other words, it is a false positive result. It can occur when the significance level of a test is set too high, or when the sample size is too small, leading to an incorrect conclusion that there is a significant difference between groups or variables when there isn't one. Type 1 error can have serious consequences in fields such as medicine and law, where incorrect decisions based on false positives can have negative impacts on individuals or society as a whole.
