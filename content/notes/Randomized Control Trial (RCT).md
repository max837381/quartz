"Gold standard" for [Causal Inference](Causal%20Inference.md)

Very rare in economics outside of laboratory settings

### Medical Trials:

Phase 1: rats
Phases 2: RCT on a few hundred hu8mans
Phase 3: RCT on thousnads of people

a = {a1,a2}

a1 = stop investing this thing
a2 = go to phase 3

False Discovery: we choose a2
False Omission: we choose a1

With a false omission we miss out on potentially discovering a blockbuster, and it might be more expensive too
