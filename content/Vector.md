Explain simply what vectors are and how they are using in data science and in programming languages like R

Vectors are mathematical objects that can be used to represent and manipulate multiple values or variables at once. In data science, vectors are often used to store and analyze large sets of data, such as survey responses or sensor readings. In programming languages like R, vectors can be created using functions like c() and used to perform operations like addition, multiplication, and indexing. Vectors are an essential tool for data manipulation and analysis in many fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data visualization.
