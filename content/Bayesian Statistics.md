In [Bayesian Statistics](Bayesian%20Statistics.md) the interpretation of what [Probability](Probability.md) means is that is a statement of *how certain you are that some statement, or proposition is true.* 

In [Bayesian Statistics](Bayesian%20Statistics.md), the [Probability](Probability.md) is in the mind, not in the world.

It is about changing your mind when [New Information](New%20Information.md) becomes available.

When we get [New Information](New%20Information.md) then we should update our [Probability](Probability.md) to take the new information into account.

[Bayesian Statistics](Bayesian%20Statistics.md) tells us how to do this *updating.*

## Probabilities

The probability we started with is called the [Prior Probability](Prior%20Probability.md), and when we get updated with new information we get a [Posterior Probability](Posterior%20Probability.md) and we can use a [Bayes Box](Bayes%20Box.md) to help us calculate the [Posterior Probability](Posterior%20Probability.md) easily.

#### Imagine the following experiment

We only know that one of the following * hypotheses* is true

 > 
 > BB: Both balls are black
 > BW: One ball is black and the other is white

Result:

 > 
 > D: The ball that was removed from the bag was black

Now let's do an Bayesian analysis of this result:

We can use the following [Prior Probability](Prior%20Probability.md)
$$ P(BB) = 0.5 $$ $$ P(BW) = 0.5 $$
$$ \frac{8}{3} $$
