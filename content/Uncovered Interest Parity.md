## Assumptions

#### Perfect capital mobility

* Necessary condition for UIP
  * convergence to a equilibrium
  * ER will adjust
  * Only works if capital mobility is not restricted
* Implies i = i\* for fixed ER
  * No independent monetary policy
* If capital flows are restricted, UIP does not have to hold
  * i =/=i\* 
    * can have independent monetary policy

UIP: Fixed ER: Future expected ER = current ER

thus i = i\*

No UIP:

i does not have to equal foreign i\*

(i = interest rate)
