McFadden's R-squared is a measure of the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model. It is a commonly used metric to evaluate how well the model fits the data. McFadden's R-squared is based on the ratio of the log-likelihoods of the fitted model and a baseline model with only an intercept term. The formula for McFadden's R-squared is:

1 - (log-likelihood of the fitted model / log-likelihood of the null model)

where the null model is a logistic regression model with only an intercept term. McFadden's R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. It is worth noting that McFadden's R-squared is not an actual coefficient of determination (like the R-squared in linear regression), but rather a pseudo-R-squared, which provides an indication of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in the model.
