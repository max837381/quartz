Allows for creation of useful models that can more confidently answer questions about the data

I believe it is more useful with smaller than ideal datasets

Smaller data = less confidence in effect sizes and significance levels

Predictions based on the whole dataset can only reflect what the model already knows, meaning that if our model is biased, our assumptions violated or we overfit, then our predictions might just be wrong

## Methods

[Training-test split](Training-test%20split.md)

[Cross-Validation](Cross-Validation.md)

[Bootstrap](Bootstrap.md)

## Why do we use resampling

Get a better fit on the data

In Machine learning we mainly care about overfitting:

Great predictions on the training data

Bad predictions on the test data
