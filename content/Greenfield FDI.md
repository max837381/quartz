Greenfield FDI refers to a type of foreign direct investment where a company establishes a new business or facility from scratch in a foreign country. This investment involves building new infrastructure, acquiring land, hiring employees and creating a new business entity. It is called "greenfield" because the investment is built on undeveloped or "green" land. 

Greenfield FDI is often considered more risky than other types of FDI since it involves starting from scratch in an unfamiliar market. However, it also offers more control and flexibility for the investing company, as they have complete ownership and control over the new venture. It also provides an opportunity to tailor the business to local conditions and preferences.

Greenfield FDI can bring significant benefits to both the investing company and the host country. For the company, it allows them to expand their operations into new markets, gain access to new customers, and potentially reduce costs through lower labor or resource costs. For the host country, greenfield FDI can bring much-needed investment and jobs, transfer technology and know-how, promote competition and innovation in local markets, and boost economic growth.

Overall, greenfield FDI is an important form of foreign direct investment that can bring significant benefits to both the investing company and the host country if managed effectively.

Most FDI is mergers and acquisitions
