## Unweighted Average

Also known as the arithmetic mean

## Weighted Average

## When to use either:

Yes, choosing the appropriate approach for calculating the average depends on the context and purpose of the analysis. Here are a few examples:

1. Market Research: Suppose you are conducting market research to find out the average income of people in a certain region. In this case, an unweighted average would be appropriate because each person's income should be given the same weight. You want to know the average income of all the people in the region, not just the wealthy individuals who earn more. Therefore, you would use an unweighted average to calculate the average income of the region.

1. Academic Grades: Suppose you want to calculate the average grade of a class, but you also want to take into account the number of credits each course carries. In this case, a weighted average would be appropriate because the number of credits each course carries is a measure of its importance in the calculation of the overall grade. So, a course that carries more credits should be given more weight in the calculation of the average grade. Therefore, you would use a weighted average to calculate the average grade of the class.

1. Environmental Sampling: Suppose you take soil samples from several different locations in a park to measure the concentration of a particular pollutant. However, some locations have more soil than others. In this case, a weighted average would be appropriate because the amount of soil at each location affects the overall concentration of the pollutant. A location with more soil will contribute more to the overall concentration than a location with less soil. Therefore, you would use a weighted average to calculate the overall concentration of the pollutant in the park.

In summary, the choice between weighted and unweighted averages depends on the context and purpose of the analysis. If all values are equally important, use an unweighted average. If certain values are more important than others, use a weighted average, where the weights reflect the relative importance of each value.
