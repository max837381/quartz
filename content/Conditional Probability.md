Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory and it is the probability of an event occurring, given some prior knowledge. This probability can be expressed mathematically using the formula: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$ Where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, $P(B|A)$ is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred, $P(A)$ is the probability of event A occurring, and $P(B)$ is the probability of event B occurring. This formula allows us to calculate the probability of a certain event occurring, given prior knowledge about that event. Furthermore, this formula can be used to determine how likely it is that a specific event will occur, depending on the information that is available. It is also useful in determining how likely it is that, given a certain set of conditions, a specific event will occur. Additionally, it can be used to calculate the probability of several events occurring at the same time, allowing us to better understand the interrelation of multiple events.

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(\text{A and B})}{P(\text{B})} \space \text{| if P(B) > 0 and undefined}$$

If B = (B1 and B2, ... etc.)

And e.g. B2 is false then B = false

If B = false then with conditional probability (the thing conditioning on being 0) then we are dividing 0/0.
