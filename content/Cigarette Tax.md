Need variation to measure impact

* Cigarettes taxed at both federal and state levels in U.S.
* Total revenue (state+fed) of about $35 billion per year, similar to estate taxation
* Federal tax increased from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack in 2009
* Variation among states: from 30 cents per pack in VA to $4.35 in NY in 2021
* Controversial commodity due to health and paternalism concerns
