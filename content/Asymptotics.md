The behavior of a function $\large f(x)$ as $\large x$ becomes very large $\large x \rightarrow \infty$

Asymptotics in statistics refers to the behavior of statistical estimators, tests, and other measures as the sample size or other relevant parameters grow to infinity. Asymptotic theory provides valuable insights into the properties of statistical methods, such as their efficiency, consistency, and robustness.

One reason why we care about asymptotics in statistics is that it helps us understand the behavior of statistical procedures in large samples, which are often used in practical applications. Asymptotic results provide us with guidance on how to choose and evaluate statistical methods that are reliable and efficient, even as the sample size grows to infinity.

Another reason why we care about asymptotics is that it provides a theoretical basis for evaluating the performance of statistical methods, even when the sample size is finite. Asymptotic results can give us a sense of how well a statistical method is likely to perform in practice, which can help us select appropriate methods and interpret the results of our analyses.

Overall, asymptotic theory is an important tool for understanding the behavior and properties of statistical methods, and is essential for the development of reliable and efficient statistical procedures.
