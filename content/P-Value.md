P-value is a **measure of similarity between things** or a probability of similarity

* High p-value = things are similar
* Low p-value = things are different

When are things **significantly different? Below 5%** of similarity
For example:

* when the similarity of your days is below 5% (p-value \< 0.05), your days are significantly different
