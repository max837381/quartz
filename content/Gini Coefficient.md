Measures how uneven a distribution is

Lorenz curve

A Lorenz curve is a graph that shows the distribution of income or wealth in a society. It plots the cumulative share of income or wealth held by a certain percentage of the population, starting from the poorest to the richest. The curve compares this distribution with an ideal line of perfect equality where everyone has an equal share. The greater the distance between the Lorenz curve and the ideal line, the more unequal the distribution of income or wealth in that society.
