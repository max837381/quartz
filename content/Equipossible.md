You have no reason to that supports to believe that any outcome would be favored over another.

These can be called [Elemental Outcomes](Elemental%20Outcomes.md).

There has to be an experiment that people would call a [Random Experiment](Random%20Experiment.md).

Then for a *True/False proposition* the [Pascal-Fermat Probability](Pascal-Fermat%20Probability.md) that A is true given your [Background Information](Background%20Information.md) which is also called the [Classical Probability](Classical%20Probability.md) is simply obtained by counting.
$$P\_{pf}(A \mid B) = P\_{c}(A \mid B)$$

This is how you 'count' to get the [Classical Probability](Classical%20Probability.md):
$$\frac{\text{\# of outcomes favored to A}}{\text{Total \# of Elemental Outcomes}}$$
