Statistically same method as RCT/RED, but ex-post from the researchers perspective

"Perfect compliance" case if the treatment itself was randomly assigned so the instrument is the treatment

e.g. winning the lottery and bankruptcy

"Imperfect compliance" if assignment to treatment only predicts actual treatment and then you could reweight it using [2SLS](2SLS.md)

Reweight by e.g. compliance rate
A Quick way that will produce wrong standard errors:

* Reduced form estimate and divided by compliance

Matrix form?
