The Law of Large Numbers is a statistical concept that states that as the number of trials or observations increases, the average of the results will tend to get closer and closer to the expected value. In other words, as the sample size grows larger, it becomes more and more likely that the average result will be close to what was expected or predicted. The Law of Large Numbers is important in statistics because it demonstrates how samples can be used to make reliable predictions about a population.
