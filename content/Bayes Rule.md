Bayes' Rule is a theorem in probability theory that states that the probability of an event, given some prior knowledge, can be calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the event by the probability of the event given the prior knowledge. This is expressed using the following formula:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred, $P(B|A)$ is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred, $P(A)$ is the probability of event A occurring, and $P(B)$ is the probability of event B occurring. This theorem is often referred to as Bayes' Theorem or Bayes' Rule. In the context of Bayes' Box, Bayes' Rule is used to calculate the probability of a certain event occurring, given some prior information.
