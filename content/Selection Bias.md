We may only have observations that do get tested or receive treatment

Suppose two groups have the same distribution:

You don't observe some of the data

You dont know the distribution of the data you do not observe:

One dimension that you care about and you don't observe it for some subsample

If they have different distributions then you will make errors with [Causal Inference](Causal%20Inference.md)

Covariant Distribution of X and Y determines selection into data and this is problematic isf this is also the relaitonship we look at for our outomce
