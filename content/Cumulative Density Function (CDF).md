A function that describes the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. This can be thought of as a cumulative probability distribution where the probability of a given event is the area under a curve up to the point of the event. For example, if the CDF of a variable is 0.2 at a point x, then the probability of the variable being less than or equal to x is 0.2.

Think of it this way: a random variable is like a box with lots of numbers in it. Every time you reach in and pick a number, you don't know what you're going to get - it could be a big number or a small number, but it's always random. The cumulative density function (CDF) is a way to measure the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a certain value. It's a cumulative probability distribution that tells you the probability of a given event by looking at the area under a curve up to the point of the event. For example, if the CDF of a variable is 0.2 at a point x, then the probability of the variable being less than or equal to x is 0.2.

CDF cannot go down

would be like abosrbindg a negative probability

* CDF of discrete random variables look like step function
