Robust”standard errors is a technique to obtain unbiased standard errors of OLS coefficients under [heteroscedasticity](https://economictheoryblog.com/2016/02/06/clrm-assumption-4/).  Remember, the presence of heteroscedasticity violates the [Gauss Markov assumptions](https://economictheoryblog.com/2015/02/26/markov_theorem/) that are necessary to render [OLS](https://economictheoryblog.com/ordinary-least-squares-ols/) the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE).
