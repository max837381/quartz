## Firms are getting older and larger

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is calculated by adding the squared market shares of all firms in a given industry. The formula for calculating HHI is:
HHI = ∑(squared market share of each firm)

$$\Large HHI = (\sum\_{i} s^2_i) * 10K$$

where the squared market share of each firm is calculated by multiplying its market share by itself.

For example, if there are three firms in an industry with market shares of 40%, 30%, and 20%, the HHI would be calculated as follows:

HHI = (0.4^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.2^2) = 0.34

The resulting HHI value represents the concentration level of the industry, with higher values indicating greater concentration and lower values indicating less concentration. In general, an HHI value below 1,500 indicates a competitive industry, while a value above 2,500 indicates a highly concentrated industry with potential antitrust concerns.

What is the HHI index and how is it calculated

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a measure of market concentration in an industry. It is calculated by adding the squared market shares of all firms in a given industry.

The resulting HHI value represents the concentration level of the industry, with higher values indicating greater concentration and potential antitrust concerns. In general, an HHI value below 1,500 indicates a competitive industry, while a value above 2,500 indicates a highly concentrated industry.
