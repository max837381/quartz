"Magic of the current account" - Galina Hale

CA = EX - IM (ignoring net factor payments)

US has negative CA = net importer

CA > 0 = net exporter

\| Current Account  | Type of Country | Borrow vs. Lend             | Consumption |
\| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
\| CA > 0           | Net Exporter    | Net Borrower (overspending) |
\| CA \< 0           | Net Importer    | Net Lender (underspending)  |
\| **CA = EX - IM** | **CA = S - I**  | **CA = Income - Spending**  |

$$\Large Y = C + I + G + NX $$
$$\Large Y = C + I + G + CA - NFP $$
y - c - g = i + ca - nfp

Y = income, output

C + I + G = spending

CA = income - spending

$$ \Large S = Y - C - G $$
$$ \Large S = I + CA $$
$$ \Large CA = S - I $$

Current accoutn decfiit = negative net exports

Less savings than investment

The current account (CA) in macroeconomics refers to the balance of trade between a country and its trading partners, including the net exports of goods and services, net income from abroad, and net transfer payments. The equation CA = S - I represents the relationship between the current account balance and national savings (S) and investment (I).

In this equation, national savings refer to all savings made by households, businesses, and the government within a country. Investment refers to all spending on capital goods such as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

When a country has a positive current account balance (i.e., it exports more than it imports), it means that it is earning more income from abroad than it is spending on imports. This surplus can be used to fund investments within the country or saved for future use. Therefore, in this situation, national savings (S) are greater than investment (I), resulting in a positive current account balance.

Conversely, when a country has a negative current account balance (i.e., it imports more than it exports), it means that it is spending more on imports than it is earning from exports. To finance this deficit, the country may need to borrow from other countries or use its own reserves. In this situation, investment (I) is greater than national savings (S), leading to a negative current account balance.

Therefore, in macroeconomics, CA = S - I represents the relationship between a country's current account balance and its levels of national savings and investment.

#### Intertemporal Approach to Current Account

If output is assumed constant

[Permanent Income Hypothesis](Permanent%20Income%20Hypothesis.md) - how is this related #todo 

CA \< 0

$$\Large C\_{today} > C\_{tomorrow}$$

CA > 0

$$\Large C\_{today} \< C\_{tomorrow}$$

CA = 0 

S = I -> r
