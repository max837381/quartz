## Production Function

#### Assumptions

* Constant returns to scale

#### Intensive Form

Assumed to satisfy:

* Zero input = zero output
* As you increase k, production should grow
* As f(k) increases, it increases at a slower rate

Inada conditions

## Investment and Consumption

We assume there is no government and the economy is a closed economy

G = 0
NX = 0

Y = C + I

Divide both sides by L

per unit of Labor

y = c + i

Assume savings equals the economy's investment and denote s as te saving rate (or investment rate). Then we have:

i = sy
i = sf(k)
c = (1-s)y

## Capital Growth
