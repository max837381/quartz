Consider an individual who lives for T periods with lifetime utility

Concave function

$$\Large U = \sum\_{t=0}^{T} u (Ct), with u'(\cdot), u''(\cdot)$$

Lifetime consumption should be smaller or equal to  than lifetime income

## Maximization Problem

$$\Large \mathcal{L} = \sum\_{t=1}^{T} u (Ct) $$

$$\Large u'(C_t) = \lambda$$

This equation means consumption (no subscript on lambda) is constant over time. Then we have:

$$\Large \sum\_{t=1}^{T} (Ct) = TC_t$$

## Implications

Impact of Permanent Income and Transitory Income

Transitory Income: $$\Large Yt - \frac{1}{T}(A_0 + \sum\_{t=1}^{T} Y_t)$$

Impact of Permanent Income on Savings

$$\Large S_t = Y_t - C_t = Y_t - \frac{1}{T}(A_0 + \sum\_{t=1}^{T} Y_t) $$
