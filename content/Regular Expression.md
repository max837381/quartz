The square brackets `[ ]` in regular expressions are used to define a character class, which means any character inside the brackets is a valid match for that position in the pattern. In this case, the character class `[+-]` specifies that the regular expression should match any string that contains either a plus sign or a minus sign immediately following the characters "BBB".
