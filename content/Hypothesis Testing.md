Let's do an example

* Monday = nothing going on = Null Hypothesis = $\large H_0$
* Saturday = friends, party = Alternative Hypothesis = $\large H_A$

Only by comparing Monday $\large H_0$ to Saturday $\large H_A$ you'll know that your Saturday is different and you experienced something new (a nice alternative to a boring Monday)

#### Null Hypothesis

* Something you know
* You expect nothing to happen
* You expect no difference
* With new data you expect nothing new

#### Alternative Hypothesis

* You hope there is something new
