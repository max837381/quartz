What determines investment:

* r = real interest rate = i - $\pi$ (approximation)
  
  * (1+r)(1+$\pi$) = 1 + i (true equation)
  * Cheap to borrow = invest more
* uncertainty about demand
  
  * equilibrium but not a good one
  * Uncertainty up = investment down
  * High uncertainty = consumption of durable goods really gets affected

Includes inventory
