One of the better non-parametric modelling techniques

WITH REPLACEMENT - each observation might be sampled multiple times 

"It is like cross-validation on steroids" - yuzaR Data Science

The data will have the same size as the data

Can also deliver robust estimates of model parameters

* Confidence intervals

## Problems

Tends to produce estimates with low variance (higher bias) which is the opposite problem to cross-validation

Which can result in slightly pessimistic estimates of model performance

Thus it would show a lower accuracy than with all the data (usually very small)

More likely to produce conservative estimates

Avoids false positives more often
