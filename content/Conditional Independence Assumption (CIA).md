The Conditional Independence Assumption in probability theory states that, given certain conditions or events, the probability of two variables is independent of each other. In simpler terms, it means that the occurrence of one event does not impact the probability of the other event happening.

However, in some cases, the conditional independence assumption may become an Unconditional Independence Assumption. This happens when the variables become completely independent of each other, regardless of any conditions or events. In other words, the assumption holds true even when there are no conditions or events that could affect the probability of the variables.
