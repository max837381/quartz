Logical internal consistency refers to the logical coherence and consistency of ideas, arguments, or statements within a particular system or framework. It involves ensuring that all the elements within a system or argument are logically connected and do not contradict each other. In other words, there should be no logical fallacies or inconsistencies within the system or argument. Logical internal consistency is important in ensuring that ideas and arguments are sound and credible.
