In a randomized encouragement design (RED), participants are randomized to receive an invitation or special encouragement to receive a treatment (e.g., some new service). Not everyone who is encouraged will take up the service, but as long as those randomly selected to receive the encouragement (the treatment group) use the service at a higher rate than the control group, the impact of the service can be estimated.

REDs typically result in two-sided non-compliance with respect to random assignment:

1. Everyone randomized to the encouragement arm will receive a special invitation to try the intervention, but only a subset of people in this group will take up this offer.

1. People randomized to the control arm will NOT receive a special invitation to try the intervention, but some will learn about it through other channels and try it out on their own.

Encouragement designs account for this non-compliance by estimating the local average treatment effect (LATE). LATE is the effect of the intervention on ‘compliers’—those who tried the intervention because they were randomly encouraged to do so but would not have tried if not encouraged.
