Programs can be categorical or means-tested

**Categorical welfare:** Eligibility determined by some demographic e.g. single motherhood or disability

**Means-tested welfare:** Eligibility determined by income and asset levels

They can also be cash or in-kind

**Cash welfare:** Provide cash benefits to recipients

**In-kind welfare:** Deliver goods, such as medical care or housing, to recipients

## Cash-based means-tested

Benefit amount = benefit guarantee - BRR * earned income

* BRR = 50% in California (Benefit Reduction Rate)
  * Phases the benefits out
  * Every dollar you earn gets taxed away at 50%
  * 0% would be universal basic income

## Poverty Measurement

1. Absolute: Disposable income \< Threshold value
1. Relative: Disposable income \< threshold value determined by median (e.g. less than 30% of median)

Absolute poverty falls in the long run with economic growth \[nobody in the US is World Bank poor] but [relative poverty](relative%20poverty.md) does not

Absolute poverty captures both growth and inequality effects while relative poverty caputres only inequality effects

## Economic Framework

[Welfare and Labor Supply](Welfare%20and%20Labor%20Supply.md)
