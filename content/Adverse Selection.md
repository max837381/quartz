Define adverse selection and explain in terms of economics

Adverse selection is a phenomenon that occurs when one party in a transaction has more information than the other party and uses this information to their advantage, which can result in negative consequences for the other party. In economics, adverse selection is often associated with insurance markets, where individuals who are more likely to make claims (i.e., those with higher risks) are more likely to purchase insurance coverage than those with lower risks. This can lead to an imbalance in the insurance pool, resulting in higher premiums for everyone and potentially causing insurers to exit the market altogether. Adverse selection can also occur in labor markets, where employers may be hesitant to hire workers who have a history of health problems or high turnover rates, leading to unequal opportunities and discrimination. Overall, adverse selection can be detrimental to market efficiency and fairness, which is why policymakers often look for ways to mitigate its effects through regulations or other interventions.
