Frequentist statistics is an approach to statistical inference that relies on the frequentist interpretation of probability. In this approach, probability is defined as the long-run frequency of an event occurring in a large number of repeated trials. Frequentist methods focus on estimating parameters of a population from a sample using techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing.

In contrast, Bayesian statistics is an approach to statistical inference that incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters of interest into the analysis. Bayesian methods use Bayes' theorem to update prior beliefs based on observed data and produce a posterior distribution of the parameters.

The key difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics is the treatment of probability. Frequentist methods rely on the probability of observing data under a null hypothesis, while Bayesian methods incorporate prior beliefs and update them based on observed data to produce a posterior distribution. This difference can lead to different conclusions and interpretations of statistical results, and the choice of approach may depend on the specific research question and available data.
