Also known as IIA

It is an assumption made with a [Multinomial Logistic Regression](Multinomial%20Logistic%20Regression.md) 

Multinomial logistic regression is a powerful tool to model choice from a finite set of alternatives, but it comes with an underlying model assumption called the independence of irrelevant alterna- tives, stating that any item added to the set of choices will decrease all other itemsâ€™ likelihood by an equal fraction.

Independence across choices

Example:

The relative preference between choice 2 and choice 3 are not affected by the irrelelvant alternative, choice 1.
