Measures with a total mass = 1

$\Omega$ - omega, defines the sample space

* Could be any set because we can put the outcomes of a random experiment into it

Could be a rectangle, where are = 1

Probability to get any outcome = 1

$\mathbb{p}$ maps subsets to numbers

We want:

$\Large \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$

$\Large \mathbb{P}(A) \space \epsilon \space \[0,1]$

Thus no matter what subset (A) we choose, the area we measure should be between 0 and 1.

$\mathbb{P}: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

A = collection of subsets

If subsets A, B are disjoint (i.e. no overlap in area)
