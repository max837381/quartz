Question: How do food stamps affect grocery store pricing?

What are the sources of variation in food stamp recipiency?

#### Idea in this paper

Number of food stamps receipients shopping at a store varies over the month due to when benefits are mailed

* Food stamps are typically arrive at the same time for a large group of people e.g. first of the month
* Are prices higher when benefits arrive compared to other times of the month within the same store

Why is this a plausible source of variation?

#### Results

* Benefit households reduce expenditures by 20 percent after the first week of the month. COntinues to decline as the monthw ears on.
* Non-food expenditures are constant over weeks for benefit households

Referred to as cycling

* Stores increase prices in high poverty areas 2-3 percent in week 1
* No change in low poverty areas
