[Causal Inference](Causal%20Inference.md) 

Causal evidence can help us understand positive relationships snd can detemrine how we want t at act given this causal evidence

[Normative](Normative.md) vs [Positive](Positive.md) 

### The motivation:

* The need for *causal evidence* 

Causal inference helps shape *effective* policies to meet [Normative](Normative.md) objectives.

## Three problems with correlations:

* [Selection Bias](Selection%20Bias.md)
* [Reverse Causality](Reverse%20Causality.md)
* [Omitted Variable Bias](Omitted%20Variable%20Bias.md)

[Ordinary Least Squares](Ordinary%20Least%20Squares.md)

## Methodologies:

Ranking:

1. [Randomized Control Trial (RCT)](Randomized%20Control%20Trial%20%28RCT%29.md)
1. *Randomized Encouragement Design*
1. "Perfect compliance" [Instrumental Variable](Instrumental%20Variable.md)
1. "Imperfect compliance" [Instrumental Variable](Instrumental%20Variable.md) ([2SLS](2SLS.md))
1. [Regression Discontinuity](Regression%20Discontinuity.md) ("sharp" or "fuzzy")
1. [Difference-in-differences](Difference-in-differences.md)
1. Variations on [Difference-in-differences](Difference-in-differences.md) such as [Synthetic Control](Synthetic%20Control.md), *matching* plus DiD, etc.
