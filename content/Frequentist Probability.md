Assumptions:

1. Repeatable process with uncertain outcomes
1. Repetitions are independent of each other and identically distributed thus [Independent Identically Distributed](Independent%20Identically%20Distributed.md).
   1. Distributed means same probability behavior on each repetition

$$P\_{F}(A \mid B) = \lim\_{n\to\infty}\frac{\text{\# of repetitions so far where A = True}}{\text{\# of repetitions so far (a.k.a. = n)}}$$

If the limit exists and is unique, then by the *Law of Large Numbers* it equals the [Classical Probability](Classical%20Probability.md) or [Pascal-Fermat Probability](Pascal-Fermat%20Probability.md) (which I believe are the same?? #edit)

You have to make a stronger assumption
