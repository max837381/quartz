Z score shows you where the value X of a particular non-standard normal distribution would lay on the [Standard Normal Distribution](Standard%20Normal%20Distribution.md)

i.e. you would get the same area above/below the value X (which is the probability)

P(Z > 1.5) = 0.067 as an example
Thus: 
P(Height > 190) = 0.067
