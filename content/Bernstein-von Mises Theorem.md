The Bernstein-von Mises theorem states that when the sample size is sufficiently large and the prior distribution is "vague" (low-information), the posterior distribution from a [Bayesian Statistics](Bayesian%20Statistics.md) analysis is approximately equal to the [Maximum Likelihood](Maximum%20Likelihood.md) (ML) estimator, which is obtained from [Frequentist Statistics](Frequentist%20Statistics.md) inference.

In other words, as the sample size gets larger, the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference converge and produce similar results. This theorem provides a justification for using either Bayesian or frequentist methods in certain situations, and helps bridge the gap between these two approaches to statistical inference.

This has practical implications for researchers who may have a preference for one approach over the other, or who may be required to use one approach for certain analyses. For example, Bayesian methods may be preferred when prior information about the parameters of interest is available, while frequentist methods may be preferred when no such information is available. However, the Bernstein-von Mises theorem suggests that in large samples with a low-information prior, the choice of method may not matter as much, and the results will be similar regardless of the approach taken.
