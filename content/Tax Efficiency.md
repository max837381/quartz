## Introduction

Government raises taxes for one of two reasons:

1. To raise revenue to finance public goods
1. To redistribute income

But to generate $1 of revenue, welfare of those taxed falls by more than $1 because the tax distorts #todo 

## Equilibrium

Consider again the partial equilibrium model

#### Excess burden

DWL = 1/2($\Delta$Q)t

Excess Burden rises with Tax Squared #todo 

## Sufficient Statistics

2 goods $\large x = (x_1,x_2)$; prices $\large (p_1,p_2)$; income Z

Utility: $\large U(x_1,x_2)$ = $\large ln(x_1) + x_2$ -> **Quasilinear**

Normalize #todo

Substitute budget constraint into objective function:

$$\Large max \space U = ln(x_1) + Z - p_1+t)x_1$$

To solve problem:

* Find $\Large x_1^\*$ satisfying $\Large dU/dx_1 = 0$ 

Define social welfare as sum of individual's

## Sufficient Statistics Approach to Welfare

What is a sufficient statistic for the welfare effects of taxation?

Social welfare function:

$$\Large W(t) =  {} $$
